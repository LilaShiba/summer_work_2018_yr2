# Summer Work

Summer work is broken into 3 parts: 
- programming 
- questions 
- IA

## Bouns Points for Next Year:
Ten bonus points for every level you reach in codewars. Next year will be hard. This is a good idea.

## Part 1: Programs to Create

Programs should be pushed to github with comments explaining what the heck is going on. A readme should be added that can teach a complete noob how to create and understand your program.
