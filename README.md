# Summer Work

Summer work is broken into 2 parts: 
- programming 
- IA

## Bouns Points for Next Year:
Ten bonus points for every level you reach in codewars. Next year will be hard. This is a good idea.

### How to Work
- Sources may be shared on slack
- Your code must be commented on by one of your peers (try using atom & teletype, github, &| or slack)
- Your final repo should be linked in slack

- [markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)


## Part 1: Programs to Create

Programs should be pushed to github with comments explaining what the heck is going on. A readme should be added that can teach a complete noob how to create and understand your program.

### You may pick any program that is complex enough. Email me to make sure the program is complex enough.


Here are a few programs that I would suggest

[p5js api data mapping animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiYdOwOrGyc)
[p5js create the game Asteroids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacZU523FyM)
[p5js Evolutionary Steering Behaviors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flxOkx0yLrY&t=242s)

## OR

Continue working with OOP in Python!

## Part 2: Section B and C
- Section B should be done
- Section C should have a working prototype
