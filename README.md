# Summer Work

Summer work is broken into 2 parts: 
- programming 
- IA

## Bouns Points for Next Year:
Ten bonus points for every level you reach in codewars. Next year will be hard. This is a good idea.

- [markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)


## Part 1: Programs to Create

Programs should be pushed to github with comments explaining what the heck is going on. A readme should be added that can teach a complete noob how to create and understand your program.

You will solve the
